<p>StormSurgeViz is a vizualization tool for storm surge model output. Storm surge model output represents data on horizontal structured grids (CGRID) or unstructured grids (UGRID). StormSurgeViz visualizes storm surge model output which conforms to a few requirements which enable StormSurgeViz to recognize and process the model output. StormSurgeViz comes preconfigured to visualize the <a href="http://coastalemergency.org/">ASGS grid</a> of <a href="http://adcirc.org/">ADCIRC</a> and <a href="http://swanmodel.sourceforge.net/">SWAN</a> model output. However, StormSurgeViz may be configured to visualize the output of any storm surge model which conforms to a few conventions recognized by StormSrugeViz. The requirements are outlined below.</p>

<a name="cf-compliance" class="anchor" href="#cf-compliance"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Climate and Forecast (CF) Compliance</h2>

<p>Models output data for independent variables located in time and space. The names of those variables, as well as the formats for specifying time and space, vary greatly from model to model. For a tool such as StormSurgeViz to recognize variables of interest and how to locate them in space and time, naming conventions are necessary. By requiring conformance to naming conventions, a tool such as StormSurgeViz may search model data for both the variables of interest as well as the locating coordinates in time and space.</p>

<p>Climatologists, meteorologists, and oceanographers have come together over the past two decades to standardize a comprehensive naming convention for variables of interest and associated metadata. The standard, the <a href="http://cfconventions.org/">Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions</a>, is universally accepted today and community-maintained. StormSurgeViz requires a minimum degree of CF-compliance. These instructions do not repeat the entirity of the CF standard, but instead outline what parts of CF conventions are necessary for StormSurgeViz to use model output.</p>

<p>CF takes an interesting approach to naming conventions. Rather than requiring specific variable names, presecribed lists of metadata are associated with each variable so that tools may derive the meaning of each variable from the associated metadata. Metadata consists of pairs, called "attributes," of both a name and a value. CF prescribes allowable attribute names and the vocabulary of attribute values for a given attribute name. Some attributes are required and some are optional.</p>

<p>CF specifies some attributes, known as "global" attributes, which apply to all variables contained in the model output. These attributes, such as the <em>title</em> attribute, are placed in the model output only once and are described in the CF Conventions <a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#description-of-file-contents">here</a>.</p>

<p>CF recommends several attributes for data variables. The most useful among these and required for StormSurgeViz is <a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#standard-name"><em>standard_name</em></a>. The CF lists a vocabulary of acceptable values for standard name <a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/28/build/cf-standard-name-table.html">here</a>. StormSurgeViz searches model output for CF standard names in order to identify variables of interest. For storm surge models these are the variables <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> for surface currents and <em>zeta</em> for wave height.</p>

<p>Two other attributes are associated with a given standard name value, <em>long_name</em> and <em>units</em>. Long names are free form text descriptions and are not standardized for particular standard names. Units are values taken from the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/">UDUNITS</a> software package. Particular standard names have prescribed lists of acceptable units values.</p>

<p>Coordinate data (latitude, longitude, vertical coordinate, and time) have special treatment within the CF standard. Coordinate data are identified by an <em>axis</em> attribute with one of the values <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, <em>Z</em>, or <em>T</em> associated with variables typically named <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>, and <em>time</em>. Applicable standard names are <em>latitude</em>, <em>longitude</em>, <em>time</em>, and <em>depth</em> or <em>height</em>.</p>

<a name="ugrid-extensions" class="anchor" href="#ugrid-extensions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>UGRID Extensions to CF</h2>

<p>If the model output is represented on an unstructured grid, StormSurgeViz recognizes a proposed extension to the CF Conventions known as <a href="https://github.com/ugrid-conventions/ugrid-conventions">UGRID</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="netcdf-format" class="anchor" href="#netcdf-format"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>NetCDF Formatting</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NetCDF</a> is a standard binary file format for array data maintained by the University Coorporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The CF Conventions were designed to take advantage of the NetCDF format. The NetCDF format facilitates global attributes, mutltidimensional data arrays (variables), and variable dimensions and attributes. StormSurgeViz requires model output stored in the NetCDF format.</p>

<p>NetCDF files may be read and written by free and open source programs (ncdump and ncgen) supplied by Unidata, a UCAR subsidiary, or by user-supplied programs which take advantage of software NetCDF libraries. Free and open source NetCDF libraries are available from both Unidata and other third parties. NetCDF libraries are available with application programming interfaces (API) in C, Java, Python, Perl, R, Fortran, and Matlab. The ncdump and ncgen programs from Unidata transforms NetCDF files into and from human readable text representations of NetCDF using a description format known as <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf_utilities_guide.html#cdl_guide">Common Data Language</a> (CDL).</p>

<a name="thredds-service" class="anchor" href="#thredds-service"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DAP Service</h2>

<p>StormSurgeViz may view NetCDF files stored on a filesystem local to the StormSurgeViz program itself. But more typically storm surge model output stored in NetCDF is large and stored on remote servers. Moving large amounts of data over network connections is inefficient. Therefore an efficient transport protocol for NetCDF known as <a href="http://www.opendap.org/support">Data Access Protocol</a> (DAP), formerly known as Distributed Ocean Data Protocol (DODS), was developed by NASA and is maintained by an NSF-supported non-profit, OpenDAP.</p>

<p>The DAP protocol allows NetCDF files to be queried for subsets of data constrained by space, time, and variable constraints. By requesting only necessary subsets of data, network transfers of data are more efficient. Programs which make DAP requests are known as DAP clients and programs which provide responses to DAP requests are known as DAP servers. StormSurgeViz is a DAP client and requires DAP server access to storm surge model output in CF-compliant NetCDF files.</p>

<p>There are many implementations of DAP servers. <a href="http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/Hyrax">Hyrax</a> is the StormSurgeViz recommended DAP server as it provides the most up-to-date standards compatibility and the best extensibility. The Hyrax server is a special type of DAP server which also implements a convention known as <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/catalog/">THREDDS</a>. The THREDDS feature of a THREDDS-enabled DAP server provides a customizable catalog of dataset holdings on a DAP server and the DAP services available for each of those holdings.</p>

<a name="stormsurgeviz-index" class="anchor" href="#stormsurgeviz-index"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>StormSurgeViz Index</h2>

<p>Storm surge model output are typically stored in NetCDF files on DAP servers with individual files for storm events, model ensembles, model runs, and possibly even individual variables. Output may also be served from more than one DAP server. StormSurgeViz requires an index of remote NetCDF resources available for viewing. These indices are constructed by running scripts which compile lists of DAP URLs corresponding to model output datasets. Construction of StormSurgeViz indices is decribed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tsu3t_uwvpymVAmKG81cmsgf6F7mCYGWpic-2L7qFEU/edit?usp=sharing">here></a>.</p>
