{"name":"AdcircViz","tagline":"A MATLAB-based tool for visualization and analysis of UGRID-compliant ADCIRC model output","body":"=======\r\nWelcome to the AdcircViz Home.\r\n=======\r\n\r\nAdcircViz is a MATLAB-based tool for visualization and analysis of CF/UGRID-compliant model output funded by NOAA's Joint Hurricane Testbed (2013) Program (<http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/jht/>).\r\n\r\nAdcircViz can be checked out either through this GitHub page, or it can alternatively be checked out via SVN, with this URL: <https://github.com/BrianOBlanton/AdcircViz>.  Just do \r\n\r\n<code>\r\nsvn co https://github.com/BrianOBlanton/AdcircViz\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nBrian Blanton, RENCI/UNC\r\n\r\nRick Luettich, IMS/UNC\r\n\r\nDocument Date: 03-Feb-2014\r\n\r\nApplication Version: 00.149\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCheck out the documentation at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a5ZLwSY1JB8t2m794KdqqLL1g8FiRQ8_pUB70ubumLU/pub\r\nor contact Brian_Blanton@Renci.Org.\r\n\r\nBasic Implementation of AdcircViz\r\n=======\r\n\r\nAdcircViz relies on making connections to the OPeNDAP server using the MATLAB toolbox nctoolbox.  This toolbox (http://nctoolbox.github.com/nctoolbox) is used extensively to open netCDF data files, without accessing the data components until they are needed.  Each graphic is generated using MATLAB functions and tools “on the fly”;  the color map, color limits and color increment are specified by the user with default values appropriate to the scalar field being rendered.  The default colormap is one similar to the NOAA colormap currently used for NHC surge maps: [Image of noaa_cmap].\r\n\r\nAll needed MATLAB code is included in the application’s distribution package.  Other than having MATLAB, no other MATLAB or external dependencies exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning AdcircViz\r\n=====\r\n\r\nStart MATLAB on your computer. In MATLAB, navigate the Current Folder to adcircviz\\trunk, where AdcircViz.m and a few other m-files are stored. The current path will be referred to as the HOME path in this manual. To open the GUI window of the AdcircViz Tool, type AdcircViz in the Command Window to get a default view. Note: Only one instance of AdcircViz GUI is allowed to run at a time. Close the previous one before open another. \r\n\r\nTo change the fontsize of the GUI window, use the FontOffset parameter to adjust, e.g., type \r\n\r\n<code>\r\nclose all;  AdcircViz('FontOffset',-2)\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nin the Command Window to get a new GUI window with fontsize reduced by 2.\r\n\r\nTo change the units of the map (default “Meters” ) to “Feet”, use the “Units” parameter to adjust, e.g., type \r\n\r\n<code>\r\nclose all; AdcircViz(‘Units’,’Feet’).\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nTo change other settings of the map, see Section 5: Changing the Catalog Parameters.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
