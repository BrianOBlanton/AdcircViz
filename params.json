This toolbox (http://nctoolbox.github.com/nctoolbox) is used extensively to open netCDF data files, without accessing the data components until they are needed.  Each graphic is generated using MATLAB functions and tools “on the fly”;  the color map, color limits and color increment are specified by the user with default values appropriate to the scalar field being rendered.  The default colormap is one similar to the NOAA colormap currently used for NHC surge maps:\r\n\r\n![Image of noaa_cmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renci-unc/StormSurgeViz/master/private/cbar.png)\r\n\r\nAll needed MATLAB code is included in the application’s distribution package.  Other than having MATLAB, no other MATLAB or external dependencies exist.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## QuickStart\r\n\r\n#### Download StormSurgeViz\r\nTo download the most recent version of StormSurgeViz, go to the top of this page (http://renci-unc.github.io/StormSurgeViz/) and click on View in GitHub and then Clone in Desktop. You may need to install a GitHub client for your OS.  You can also download a zip file of the code, but each time the code is updated, you will need to get a new zip file and delete the old downloaded directory/folder. Using the GitHub client will allow for easy updating of the code.\r\n\r\n#### Add StormSurgeViz to the MATLAB PATH\r\nThe cloned repository will be put into a directory called StormSurgeViz, in a location specified by the user.  Put this path <PathToGithubRepositories/StormSurgeViz > into the MATLAB path, perhaps in the user’s or system startup.m file. For example:\r\n\r\n````\r\nSSVizHome='/home/myusername/GitHubRepos/StormSurgeViz';\r\naddpath(SSVizHome)\r\n````\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n#### Run StormSurgeViz\r\nStart MATLAB.  To open the GUI window of the StormSurgeViz Tool, type StormSurgeViz in the Command Window to get a default view. \r\n\r\n````\r\nStormSurgeViz\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis should result in a large GUI that looks like the following:\r\n\r\n![Starting View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renci-unc/StormSurgeViz/master/private/AdcircViz_StartingView.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe default catalog is RENCI's OPeNDAP server, and the most recent ADCIRC simulation entry is retrieved and displayed.  Depending on when the user starts StormSurgeViz, the actual solution and details in the above figure will vary, but the format and layout of the GUI should like that shown. \r\n\r\n**Note: Only one instance of StormSurgeViz GUI is allowed to run at a time. Close the previous one before open another.**\r\n\r\n#### Change font size \r\nIf the fonts and GUI layout is cramped, change the fontsize of the GUI window by setting the **FontOffset** parameter to adjust, e.g., type \r\n\r\n````\r\nclose all;  StormSurgeViz('FontOffset',-2)\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### Change scalar field units\r\nTo change the units of the map (default “Meters” ) to **Feet**, use the **Units** parameter to adjust, e.g., type \r\n\r\n````\r\nclose all; StormSurgeViz('Units','Feet')\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### Point to a different Thredds Server\r\nTo view a different Thredds Server, use the **ThreddsServer** parameter to specify a different URL, as in \r\n````\r\nclose all; StormSurgeViz('ThreddsServer','http://coastalmodeldev.data.noaa.gov/thredds')\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### Point to a different catalog file\r\nTo specify a different catalog file, use the **Catalog** parameter to specify a different URL.  For example, to view the catalog file with only the small, coarse-grid ec_95d test files on the default RENCI Thredds Server, type\r\n\r\n````\r\nclose all; StormSurgeViz('CatalogName','catalog.tree.tc.ec95d')\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### Plotting vector fields\r\nVector plotting is enabled when the user checks on an available vector field (e.g., **Wind Velocity**) and sets a time in the Vector Snapshot List.  To have both water level and wind vectors simultaneously, the user must also check the **Water Level** field.  Parameters for tuning the vector drawing are accessible through the **Vector Options** panel, which is enabled by clicking on the VO button ![VO button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renci-unc/AdcircViz/master/private/vo.png) in the main MATLAB toolbar.  These details are shown in the following screen-grab, with red boxes around the places to enable.\r\n\r\n![Vector View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renci-unc/StormSurgeViz/master/private/AdcircViz_VectorView.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## Complete Documentation\r\n\r\nDetailed documentation for StormSurgeViz is maintained on Google Docs, at this URL:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1a5ZLwSY1JB8t2m794KdqqLL1g8FiRQ8_pUB70ubumLU/pub","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
